      A nanny is a person who provides child care. Typically, this care
      is given within the children's family setting. Throughout history,
      nannies were usually servants in large households and reported
      directly to the lady of the house. Today, modern nannies, like
      other domestic workers, may live in or out of the house, depending
      on their circumstances and those of their employers. There are
      many[quantify] employment agencies that specialize in childcare.
      Nannies in many[quantify] areas are a sought after member of the
      workforce.

              A nanny is a person who provides child care. Typically, this care
              is given within the children's family setting. Throughout history,
              nannies were usually servants in large households and reported
              directly to the lady of the house. Today, modern nannies, like
              other domestic workers, may live in or out of the house, depending
              on their circumstances and those of their employers. There are
              many[quantify] employment agencies that specialize in childcare.
              Nannies in many[quantify] areas are a sought after member of the
              workforce. Many[quantify] nannies become a part of their family's
              household. Although previously[when?] looked at as a lesser-than
              job[by whom?], today's demand has made it a popular and valued
              addition to the lives of the family's household[opinion]. Nannies
              differ slightly from other child care providers. A childminder
              works out of their own home, operating as a small business. In
              America, childminders are often advertised as a daycare. Depending
              on the country the childminder or daycare is in, government
              registration may or may not be required. Within the UK, a
              childminder must be Ofsted registered, hold a current paediatric
              first aid qualification, public liability insurance and follow the
              EYFS. A mother's helper is someone who may live in or out of the
              household, and assists the person of the house with general chores
              as well as caring for the children. The term au pair usually
              refers to a young person, who comes from abroad to live with the
              host family and learn the local culture and language, while
              helping care for the children. A governess concentrates on
              educating children inside their own home, and a kindergarten or
              schoolteacher does the same, but in a school environment. Even
              though there are no legal requirements to be considered a nanny,
              families may require a background check or a CPR certification.
              Families may also look for other special skills in a nanny, such
              as being bilingual or having early childhood development
              coursework done. Nannies help play a key role in a child's
              development by providing care.
